# In-Game Options:
In-game configurable options are described here.

## Flare Rendering

Flares are simple spots that are drawn to show the location of planets, moons, and vessels, as well as debris (when enabled).

`Show names on mouseover`: This checkbox controls whether flare names are displayed when the mouse hovers near them.

`Flare Saturation`: This slider controls the saturation of planet and moon flares.  A lower saturation value will make the flares appear white, while a higher saturation will show more color on the flare.

`Flare Size`: This slider controls the size of the flares.

`Flare Brightness`: This slider can be used as a master control for the brightness of the flares.

`Show debris flares`: This checkbox controls whether or not flares are drawn for debris.

`Debris Brightness`: When `Show debris flares` is checked, this slider can be used to adjust the relative brightness of debris flares.
